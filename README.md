# WPFRegisterStudent
IT 230 C# project

The goal of the application I developed was to allow students to register for up to three courses (or 9 credit hours) by selecting from a list, ensuring no duplicates or invalid options. 
It was designed with user needs in mind by keeping the process simple, clear, and responsive, each step provides immediate feedback and confirms choices. 
I think I did well in keeping the code organized and readable while enforcing the registration rules through clean logic and validation. 
Comparing the console and WPF versions, the console app is more straightforward and text-based, while the WPF version offers a more user-centered experience with visual elements like buttons, course lists, and real-time updates. 

The WPF design made it easier for users to see their choices and avoid mistakes. 

During development, I focused on clear control flow and small test cycles to catch bugs early. I used comments to guide my debugging and checked output against expected behavior. 
One challenge was keeping the logic both strict (to meet the rules) and flexible (for a good user experience), which required a bit of creativity, especially in designing the course validation and credit limit checks. 

These strategies will definitely come in handy for future projects too!
